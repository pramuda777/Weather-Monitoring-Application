# Weather-Monitoring-System
A Java-based Weather Monitoring Application that fetches real-time weather data and weather forecast data for the day from an external API and displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. This application is designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, providing a clear view of current weather conditions for a specified location.

A detailed forecast for specific times of the day: 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00.<br>

### Technologies
Java: Used for implementing the backend logic, including API requests, data handling, and 
business logic.<br>
FXML: Utilized for designing the graphical user interface (GUI). FXML allows for the separation of 
design and functionality, making the UI more dynamic and easier to maintain.<br>
JavaFX: A powerful toolkit used to integrate FXML with Java, ensuring smooth interaction 
between the backend and frontend.<br>
IntelliJ IDEA: Our integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, testing, and debugging 
the code.<br>
Open Weather API: Provides weather data for various cities. The API returns information such as 
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts, which our backend processes for the client.<br>
